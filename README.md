Hello World!<br>
Wait, I want it to be like a title, like a heading.

How do I...<br>
How do I make "Hello World" a heading?

<br>

```
Like this?
No, not like this
```
<br>

Huh...

<br>

> Maybe like that?<br>
> Again, apparently not.

<br>

Well this is harder than I expected.

<br>

~~Hello World!~~<br>
~~Definitely not.~~

<br>

**Hello Wo- Nope.**<br>
_Hello World? Not this either._<br>
***Hello W- Well now that's just hyperbole.***<br>

<br>

Come on, it can't be _that_ hard.<br>

Wait, maybe:<br>

<br>

H<sup>E</sup>L<sub>L</sub>
L<sup>O</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;W<sub>O</sub>
R<sup>L</sup>D<sub>!</sub><br>

H<sup>O</sup>W&nbsp;&nbsp;D<sub>I</sub>
D&nbsp;&nbsp;T<sup>H</sup>I<sub>S</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;E<sup>V</sup>E<sub>N</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;H<sup>A</sup>P<sub>P</sub>
E<sup>N</sup>?

<br>

<br>

Ok, that's it.<br>
<sub>***I GIVE UP***</sub><br>
***. . .***

<br>
<br>
<br>

... WAIT!

<br>

### **I know what to do!**<br>

<br>

# ***Hello, World!***

<br>

_<sub>I don't like that line</sub>_
